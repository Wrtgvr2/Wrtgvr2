## Hi there, Im Danil ðŸ‘‹

Currently working on [ToDo Rest API](https://github.com/Wrtgvr2/todoapi)
- Iâ€™m currently learning Backend development (Golang)
- Ask me about.. don't ask me.
- How to reach me: Go outside, clap your hands 3 times, jump in place 1 time, turn around 10 times, go back home, write something in my GitHub, for example, in errors section of some project
- Fun fact: GetFunfact()
